Write two separate connection-oriented C programs (one for the Server and one for Client) using UNIX socket APIs for following operations with acknowledgements.
1. Server displays the client’s IP address and port number on the server screen in the form of one string (ip_address:portnumber e.g. 192.16.0.1:8080) and writes the same string in the file. (4M: 2.5M to communication and display and 1.5M to write in file) 
2. Server should replace the “.” from the ip address with string “dot” and “:” with the string “colon”. (4M: for replacing 3 dots and one colon)
3. Server sends the replaced string to the client to display (e.g., Output on the screen: 192dot16dot0dot1colon8080). (2M: communication and display)
